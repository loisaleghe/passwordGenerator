# Password Generator Based on User's Requirement

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

1. A series of prompts are shown when button is clicked
2. Randomly generate password based on criteria chosen
3. Prompt should request if user wants lowercase, uppercase, special character and numbers
4. The length of the password should be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
